Exploring Scheduling Algorithms for CPU
Algorithms to Implement:

First-Come, First-Served (FCFS): A non-preemptive algorithm where the process that arrives first is executed first.

Shortest Job First (SJF): Implement both preemptive and non-preemptive versions. Preemptive SJF is also known as Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF).

Round Robin (RR): Preemptive algorithm where each process is assigned a fixed time slot (quantum).

Priority Scheduling: Implement both preemptive and non-preemptive versions. Processes are executed based on priority.

Multilevel Queue Scheduling: Extension of your implementation, involving multiple queues, each with its own scheduling algorithm
